            <img src="./images/Jackson.webp" alt="Jackson Doggo">
            <p>Jackson Sirius was my first dog. He was a Border Collie mix and he was a very good boy.
               He loved to go for walk, take float trips, and play fetch. He lived to be 14 1/2 years old.

         <img src="./images/Roxie.jpg" alt="Roxie Doggo">
            <p>Roxie was the second dog I got. She is a Papillon and is currently almost 15 years old.
               She was a very smart dog in her prime and knew all sorts of tricks. These days she doesn't
               always understand what is going on around her, but she's still pretty healthy overall.

         <h2>Stitch</h2>
         <img src="./images/Stitch.jpg" alt="Stitch Doggo">
            <p>Stitch was my Terrier mix who I found at 3 weeks old on a camping trip.
               He was separated from his parents and siblings too early and he had
               some issues because of it that were hard to work with. We made a lot
               of progress, but he ended up needing to find a new home when I had to
               move to an apartment.

         <h2>Link</h2>
         <img src="./images/Link.jpg" alt="Link Doggo">
            <p>I got Link to be a friend for Stitch. He was a Miniature Pinscher mix
               who came from a shelter after spending the first half of his life
               living in a puppy mill. He also ended up being older than I thought,
               had clearly been abused, and took a lot of work to make him happy and
               healthy. He also went to a new home when I had to move into an apartment.

         <h2>Katiebell</h2>
         <img src="./images/Katiebell.jpg" alt="Katiebell Doggo">
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Katiebell is an American Bulldog mix who I took in as a foster after
               she and her litter were dumped in a box on a sidewalk in the middle of
               summer. She was immediately my soul dog and after I was told I would
               benefit from a service dog, she went to work with a trainer to become
               that for me. She is now 7 years old and has mostly been able to retire.
               She is still a very good girl who I adore and who loves to play, snuggle,
               and go on walks.

         <h2>Noble</h2>
         <img src="./images/Noble.jpg" alt="Noble Doggo">
            <p>Noble was an American Staffordshire Terrier who I adopted from a shelter.
               He was a really loving dog who was super silly and loved to cuddle.
               Unfortunately he ended up having trouble with dog aggression, which was very
               difficult to manage living in a house with several other dogs. After my
               daughter was born, he was showing some red flags with her and I ultimately
               had to let him go. He'll always be my handsome, sweet boy, though.

         <img src="./images/Ocean.jpg" alt="Ocean Doggo">
            <p>Ocean is a Bernese Mountain Dog and Poodle mix, otherwise known as a
               Bernedoodle. She is a silly girl who is all about snuggles. She also
               loves to play with her toys.
